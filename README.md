1. To get the app running you want to download everything to your computer.
 2. Then you want to get the file path of recording.wav. 
 3. Once you have the file path you want to copy, go to app, then src, then main, then PantryPal.java,
 scroll down to SuggestWindowBody extends Vbox and in the ```String FILE_PATH``` paste the file path to recording.wav.
4. Once this is done open the terminal and make sure you are in cse-110-project-team-23.
 5. If you are, then in the terminal type ```./gradlew run``` which will run the project for you.
